## Customer Chrun Prediction Project
- Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

Content
- Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).

The “Churn” column is our target.
- The two sets are from the same batch, but have been split by an 80/20 ratio.
-  As more data is often desirable for developing ML models, let's use the larger set (that is, churn-80) for training , and the smaller set (that is, churn-20) for final testing and model performance evaluation.
